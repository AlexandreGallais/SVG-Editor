# Feature audit

Audit: $ARGUMENTS. Checklist: `docs/conventions/audit.md` (A–G); findings go in the story's **Findings** table, with evidence.

1. **Scope**: the feature's functions (`@see` targets, tests, derivations) in depth; the whole project in breadth.
2. **Independent review**: delegate to the `auditor` subagent, with the feature id, the list of its files and derivations, and the checklist sections A, B, C, D, E. It returns findings with evidence; it does not edit.
3. **Mutation spot-checks (A4)** yourself, one per function at least: change one operator, sign or constant; run its test file; record the mutation and the failing test; restore with `git checkout -- <file>` and check `git status` is clean.
4. **Properties**: add `test.prop` properties to functions of the feature that lack them (ADR-0022).
5. **Verify each finding** of the auditor before recording it: reproduce it; a gap that does not affect correctness or the requirements is recorded as "no action" with the reason.
6. **Fix** small findings in the audit's commits; larger ones become stories (Product Owner decides their priority).
7. **Breadth checks**: `npm run check:all`; the weekly link check is green (or run lychee); `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/`, `docs/conventions/`, `docs/tooling/` still describe reality.
8. **G**: list the sources and questions the next feature needs, for its spike.
9. Branch, commits per task, pull request as for a story (`/story` steps 3–10).
