# ADR-0004 — Orthogonal pipes only

**Status**: Accepted

## Context

Pipes must stay readable. The user hesitated about straight 45° routes.

## Decision

- Pipes made exclusively of horizontal and vertical segments.
- Ports declare an exit direction (N, E, S, W).
- Diagonals excluded in v1.

## Consequences

- Consistent with process diagram conventions (horizontal and vertical lines).
- Orthogonal routing algorithms from the literature apply directly.
- Diagonals can be reintroduced by a later ADR.
