# Architecture Decision Records

Format: Status, Context, Decision, Consequences, References.
An accepted ADR is never rewritten: it is superseded by a new ADR (`Superseded by ADR-XXXX`).
All ADRs were translated from French to English on 2026-10-08 (project rule: English everywhere); the decisions are unchanged.
