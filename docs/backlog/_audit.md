# E00 · F00 · AUD-000 — Audit F00

Full check of F00 in depth and of the project in breadth, following [audit.md](../../conventions/audit.md) (ADR-0020).

## Acceptance criteria

- Given the functions of F00, when audited, then every formula is re-derived, every expected value recomputed by hand, and each function survives a mutation spot-check.
- Given the sources, when audited, then every `@see` of F00 is re-verified online and dated.
- Given the project, when audited, then no duplicate, no copied code and no inconsistency between code, domain, ADRs and docs remains unrecorded.

## Tasks

One task = one commit, referenced as `AUD-000.Tn`.

- [ ] T1 — A. Mathematics and mutation spot-checks (2 h)
- [ ] T2 — B. Sources re-verified (1 h)
- [ ] T3 — C, D, E. Provenance, duplicates, consistency (2 h)
- [ ] T4 — F, G. Quality gates and research list for the next feature; findings table (1 h)
