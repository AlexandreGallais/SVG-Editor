# E03 — Combine shapes without losing their numbers

| Field                       | Content                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| For                         | symbol designers                                                                  |
| who                         | need composite outlines                                                           |
| the solution                | non-destructive booleans and shape builder                                        |
| is a                        | boolean nodes evaluated at each render                                            |
| that                        | operands stay integer and editable                                                |
| unlike                      | destructive path operations                                                       |
| our solution                | nothing is flattened; the result is recomputed                                    |
| Business outcomes           | the six operations and the shape builder work on rounded shapes and stay editable |
| Leading indicators          | operations accepted on reference cases                                            |
| Non-functional requirements | exact on segments and arcs; robust predicates                                     |
| In scope                    | union, difference, intersection, exclusion, division, cut path, shape builder     |
| Out of scope                | destructive flattening, corner radius on created vertices (Q9)                    |
| Closure criteria            | each operation demonstrated on rounded operands edited afterwards                 |

## Candidate features
