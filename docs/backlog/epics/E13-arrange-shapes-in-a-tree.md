# E13 — Arrange shapes in a tree and lay them out

Idea of the Product Owner (2026-10-10, refining F07): an epic between the shapes and the symbols, about the tree only, so that shapes can hold other shapes « au moins en termes de code », and the layout box (Q21) can place them.

| Field                       | Content                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| For                         | symbol designers                                                                                                                              |
| who                         | need to place shapes and text inside a box, in line with each other, without computing every position                                         |
| the solution                | a shape tree and a layout box                                                                                                                 |
| is a                        | a tree of nodes in the model; a rectangular box that places its children by anchor, or stacks them in a row or a column with gaps and padding |
| that                        | every child keeps its integer numbers; its position is derived from the box                                                                   |
| unlike                      | Figma, where a child leaving the auto layout (absolute position) no longer follows its parent                                                 |
| our solution                | a child may override the box's anchor and stay laid out by it: « toi, tu vas aller fixé en bas à gauche du layout »                           |
| Business outcomes           | a box holding a polygon, a rectangle and a text places them by its anchor, one child overriding it, and the result stays editable             |
| Leading indicators          | Q21 settled; tree in the model; layout reference cases accepted                                                                               |
| Non-functional requirements | derived positions never written back into the model (ADR-0003); integer inputs only                                                           |
| In scope                    | shape tree in the model (groups, children, stacking order), layout box, anchor per child, row and column stacking with gaps, padding          |
| Out of scope                | layers panel (rename, hide, lock: `interaction.md` §6, end of project); a box resizing to its children (Figma's hug); a non-rectangular box   |
| Closure criteria            | the layout cases of `shapes.md` §3 render as specified in the playground                                                                      |

## Candidate features

| Feature                               | Status    |
| ------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Shape tree in the model               | to refine |
| Layout box with an anchor             | to refine |
| Child overriding the anchor           | to refine |
| Row and column stacking, gap, padding | to refine |

## To refine

- **Name**: « layout » is Figma's word; keep it only if it is the best term, otherwise find another (Product Owner): to be sourced at the epic's first spike.
- **Order** (confirmed by the Product Owner, 2026-10-10): third, before E03, because its non-destructive booleans are nodes of the tree (ADR-0006); E05's symbols are then groups of this tree.
- **Settled (Product Owner, 2026-10-10)**: a child given its own anchor stays in the box but leaves the stack completely; the stack keeps the box's layout. Stacks only exist while the symbol is edited: once used, every position is fixed (see `shapes.md` §3, Q21).
- F07 (the polygon anchored in its own box) is the first, single-child case: E13 reuses its 3 × 3 anchor.
