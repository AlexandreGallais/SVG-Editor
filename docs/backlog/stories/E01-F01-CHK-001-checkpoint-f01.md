# E01 · F01 · CHK-001 — Checkpoint in the middle of F01

Pause between the geometry and the rendering stories of F01: bring documentation and methods up to date as the project grows, before going on (ADR-0028, `/run` skill).

## Acceptance criteria

- Given the stories merged since the spike, when the checkpoint runs, then `docs/domain/`, derivations, references, conventions, `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/rules/` describe the code as it is.
- Given the light evolvability check, when it runs, then each of its six questions has a one-line answer and anything worth acting on is in the improvement log.
- Given the user stories merged so far, when the checkpoint ends, then their Product Owner test cards are listed for the next stop.

## Tasks

One task = one commit, referenced as `CHK-001.Tn`.

- [ ] T1 — Consistency of code, docs and agent configuration; fixes (1 h)
- [ ] T2 — Light evolvability check; improvement log; test cards listed (0.5 h)

## Light evolvability check (2026-10-09)

| Tools               | StrykerJS still blocked (stryker-js issue 6210 open); the auditor subagent plays the mutation role meanwhile (one real defect found per code story). **`knip` trigger reached** (\"when `src/` has several layers\": five now) — decision for the retrospective, improvement log                                                                            |

| Agent configuration | `CLAUDE.md` + rules 182 lines after T1 (179 before); three rules added to the library rules (`tsc` before commit, signed zeros, parameter objects); guards never hit in this run                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Product Owner test cards so far

None in the run yet: US-003 is its first user story and its card comes with it. The user stories done before ADR-0028 (US-001, US-002, US-004) have no card; their behaviors are covered by the demo page of VAL-001.
