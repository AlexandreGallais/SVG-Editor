# E01 · F01 · SP-001 — Research for the remaining stories of F01

Find, read and record the sources of EN-005, EN-006, EN-007, US-003 and VAL-001 before implementing them (ADR-0020, added after F01 was refined).

## Acceptance criteria

- Given EN-005 to VAL-001, when the spike ends, then every formula and behavior they need has a verified `REF-*`, a `DERIV-*` or an open research request.
- Given the sources found, when the spike ends, then the stories' criteria and tasks cite them, and research note 0003 records what was found and what remains open.

## Questions

Inventory (T1): what each remaining story needs, and where it comes from.

| Story   | Needs                                                                                                                                        | Source                                                                                                          |
