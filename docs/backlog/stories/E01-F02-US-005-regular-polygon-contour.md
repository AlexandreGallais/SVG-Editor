# E01 · F02 · US-005 — Regular polygon contour fitted in its box

As a symbol designer, I want a regular polygon defined by an integer number of corners, width and height so that it fills its box as much as possible while staying regular.

## Acceptance criteria

- Given n = 3 in 100 × 100, when the contour is built, then it is 100 wide and 86.60254 high, centered vertically: (50, 6.69873), (100, 93.30127), (0, 93.30127) (`DERIV-regular-polygon-fit`).
- Given n = 4 in 100 × 50, when the contour is built, then it is the square (25, 0), (75, 0), (75, 50), (25, 50): the height is reached, the width is not.
- Given n = 6 in 100 × 100, when the contour is built, then it is 100 wide and 86.60254 high, with flat top and bottom edges.
- Given a width or a height of 0, when the contour is built, then the degenerate polygon is accepted (Q15).
- Given n < 3, n not an integer, n above the maximum of Q19, or a negative size, when the polygon is created, then it is refused.
- Given any valid polygon, when the contour is built, then only n, width, height and radius are stored; the vertices are derived (ADR-0003).

## Product Owner test

None of its own: this story has no playground yet; its cases are shown by US-007's card.

## Tasks

One task = one commit, referenced as `US-005.Tn`.

- [ ] T1 — Tests of the cases above, each expected value computed by hand (1.5 h)
- [ ] T2 — Model type, validity check and contour function in `src/model/` (2 h)
- [ ] T3 — Re-exports (`npm run fix`), domain and derivation brought up to date (0.5 h)
