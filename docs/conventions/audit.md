# Feature audit

The `AUD` story closing every feature (ADR-0020). It checks the feature **in depth** and the whole project **in breadth**. Each check leaves evidence in the story's **Findings** table; a problem is fixed in the audit, or becomes a story.

Procedure: the `/audit` skill. Sections A to E are first reviewed by the independent `auditor` subagent (fresh context, read-only, ADR-0021); each of its findings is reproduced before being recorded.

## A. Mathematics (feature, in depth)

1. Re-derive every formula of the feature from its `@see` (derivation or reference), without looking at the code.
2. Recompute every expected test value by hand; compare with the test.
3. Look for missing cases: degenerate input (0, empty, aligned, coincident), sign, bounds, very large values.
4. **Mutation spot-check**: break each function once (flip a sign, swap an operator, change a constant) and check that at least one test fails; restore. Record each mutation and the failing test.
5. **Properties**: every function with a stateable invariant has `test.prop` properties (ADR-0022); add the missing ones.

## B. Sources

1. Feature: re-open every `@see` target online — still reachable, still saying what is cited; update the `[verified] YYYY-MM-DD` date in `docs/references.md`.
2. Project: the weekly link check (`links.yml`) is green — run it on demand if needed; `[unverified]` rows: try again, or keep them uncited.
3. No `@see` points to an `[unverified]` row (lint guarantees it; check no `eslint-disable` bypasses it).

## C. Provenance (no copied code)

1. Every function is written from its derivation or specification, not from third-party code; its TSDoc formula matches its body.
2. No comment, identifier pattern or structure taken from a known library; when in doubt, search the distinctive line on GitHub code search.
3. Licenses: GPL / LGPL code was only read (`docs/research/` §4); no dependency added without its row in `docs/tooling/dependencies.md`.

## D. Duplicates

1. Exported API (`npm run docs:api`, or `src/**`): no two functions for one concept, no near-identical helpers.
2. Derivations and references: no two documents for the same result; no URL under two IDs (`references.test.ts`).
3. Tests: no copy-pasted test hiding a missing case.

## E. Consistency

1. Code ↔ TSDoc ↔ derivation ↔ `docs/domain/` ↔ ADRs say the same thing.
2. Open questions of `docs/domain/README.md`: still open, or answered by the feature.
3. `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/conventions/`, `docs/tooling/` describe what the project really does.
4. Backlog: statuses, feature plan, epic table up to date.

## F. Quality gates

1. `npm run check:all` green; coverage 100 %; `npm run build` green.
2. No `.skip` / `.only` in tests; every `eslint-disable` has a justification still valid.
3. The feature is demonstrable (playground or tests) for its `VAL` story.
4. Agent configuration (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/`, skills) still matches the project; contradictions removed.

## G. Next feature

List the sources and questions the next feature will need: they feed its research spike.

## Findings table (in the `AUD` story)

| Check                                        | Result | Evidence                                   | Action |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| A4 — mutation of `filletSetback` (sign of τ) | caught | `fillet-setback.test.ts` "direction" fails | —      |

Regression and end-to-end tests are added when the applications exist (ADR-0020), not by the feature audits.
