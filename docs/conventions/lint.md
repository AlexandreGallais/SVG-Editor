# ESLint

## Principle

- **Every rule of every plugin is decided once**, explicitly: enabled, configured, or disabled with its reason as a comment. No preset (`recommended`, `strict`…) is imported: the list is read, every rule is settled.
- Everything is `error`. `npm run lint` uses `--max-warnings=0`.
- **Strictest by default, relaxed by zone**: the files of `eslint/rules/` describe the strictest setting (the functional core's); `eslint/scopes/` relaxes or tightens by path.
- The test `eslint/config.test.ts` (run by `npm run test`) fails when a rule is undecided, decided twice, non-existent, or when a zone touches an undecided rule.

## Layout of `eslint/`

```text
eslint.config.ts          entry point: export default CONFIG
eslint/
  config.ts               assembly: ignores → language → Prettier → themes → zones
  config.test.ts          completeness audit
  settings/               data tables (layers, kinds, verbs, globs, limits…)
  rules/<plugin>/<theme>.ts   one file per theme, one constant per file
  rules/<plugin>/all.ts   list of the plugin's themes
  scopes/                 path overrides (core, shell, modules, tests, tooling, barrels)
  plugin/                 custom plugin `local/*`: rules, utilities, tests
```

The `eslint/` folder itself keeps kebab-case files exporting one constant each; the one-export rule targets the library and the playground.

## Changing a rule

1. Find the theme: `grep -rn '"rule-name"' eslint/rules`.
2. Change the value **in that file only**; if it becomes `off`, write the reason as a comment above it.
3. A value taken from a table (`GLOBAL_FUNCTION_CEILING`, `PROCEDURE_VERBS`…) is changed in `eslint/settings/`.
4. A path-specific exception goes to `eslint/scopes/`, never to `rules/`.
5. `npm run check`.

After a plugin upgrade, `npm run test` lists the new rules to decide: add them to the right theme.

## One-off exceptions

`// eslint-disable-next-line rule -- justification` — the justification is mandatory (`unicorn/no-abusive-eslint-disable`), an unused directive is an error.

## Known autofix pitfall

`unicorn/prefer-import-meta-properties` replaces `fileURLToPath(new URL(".", import.meta.url))` (trailing slash) with `import.meta.dirname` (no trailing slash): concatenated paths break. Always build paths with `join()`.

## Custom rules (`local/*`)

Code: `eslint/plugin/rules/`, one test file per rule.

### `local/require-kind`

Every top-level function carries exactly one known `@kind`. ADR-0011.

### `local/kind-in-layer`

The `@kind` is allowed in the file's layer (`eslint/settings/layers.ts`).

### `local/kind-limits`

Lines, statements, complexity and depth bounded by `@kind` (`eslint/settings/kinds.ts`).

### `local/kind-naming`

Name fitting the kind: verb for `procedure`, conversion for `format`, no vague verb for `math`/`geometry`/`domain`, predicate prefix ⇔ boolean return.

### `local/see-references`

Every function has a `@see`; every `@see` points to an existing, **verified** reference (`REF-*`, `DERIV-*`, `ADR-NNNN`, `docs/…md`).

### `local/one-export-per-file`

One exported value per module, named like the file; a type may sit next to it only if it is part of its signature. ADR-0015.

### `local/folder-has-index`

Every code folder holds an `index.ts`. ADR-0012.

### `local/barrel-exports`

An `index.ts` contains only `export * from "./x";`, one per module, sorted. Autofixed.

### `local/canonical-import-path`

Shortest legal import path: the file within the same folder, the folder otherwise, never `index` nor `.ts`. Autofixed.
