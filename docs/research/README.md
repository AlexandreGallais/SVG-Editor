# Research protocol

Goal: every function, rule or decision is justified by an identified source. This page says **where to look**, **in which order**, and **when to stop and ask**.

## 1. Search order (escalation)

| Level | Where                                                                     | If insufficient |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1     | `docs/domain/`                                                            | level 2         |
| 2     | `docs/adr/`                                                               | level 3         |
| 3     | `docs/derivations/`, `docs/references.md`, `docs/research/notes/`         | level 4         |
| 4     | Primary external sources through WebSearch / WebFetch (when available)    | level 5         |
| 5     | Reference implementations, **read only** (see §4)                         | level 6         |
| 6     | **STOP.** Write a request in `research/requests/` and hand it to the user | —               |

Every level-4 or level-5 finding is recorded in `research/notes/` and in `docs/references.md` **before** writing code.

## 2. Source reliability hierarchy

1. Normative specification (W3C, ISO, ISA)
2. Peer-reviewed paper
3. Reference book
4. Official software documentation (Figma, Inkscape, draw.io)
5. Open-source code
6. Blog, forum, course material — **never as the only source**

Two concurring sources of level ≥ 4 are required for an interface behavior rule.

## 3. Topic map

## 4. Licenses of reference implementations

| Project            | License     | Rule                                                           |
| ------------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inkscape, libavoid | GPL / LGPL  | read to understand; **no copy, no line-by-line translation**   |
| Clipper2, Paper.js | Boost / MIT | same rule on principle: reimplement from the paper or the spec |

Project code is always justified by a level 1 to 4 source or a derivation, never by "it is done this way in X".

## 5. Research request (level 6)

When the documentation is insufficient, Claude Code:

1. stops implementing;
2. copies `requests/_template.md` to `requests/NNNN-topic.md` and fills it in;
3. asks the user to run the research in Claude (chat, web research), see §6;
4. records the answer in `notes/NNNN-topic.md`, updates `docs/references.md`, then resumes.

## 6. Running a research in Claude (chat)

Claude Code does not always have web access, and a serious bibliographic search takes reading time. When a request is open (§5), the user runs it in **claude.ai**:

| Setting                | Value                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Model                  | the most capable one available (Claude Opus family)                                                     |
| Mode                   | **Research** enabled, to read online sources                                                            |
| Input                  | the "Precise question" section of the request, pasted as is, followed by the "Expected deliverable"     |
| Requirement to restate | primary sources (spec, paper, book) with DOI or URL; say explicitly when a source was not read directly |

On receiving the answer, Claude Code:

1. summarizes it in its own words in `notes/NNNN-topic.md` (no copy of source text);
2. adds every source to `docs/references.md`: **`[verified] YYYY-MM-DD`** only if it was read (by Claude Code through WebFetch, or attested as read by the answer); otherwise **`[unverified]`**;
3. sets the request status to "done".

## 7. Research done by Claude Code itself

When WebSearch / WebFetch are available, Claude Code may do levels 4 and 5 without a request. Same recording: note in `notes/`, dated entry in `docs/references.md`, **before** the code. Example: [note 0001](./notes/0001-tooling-practices.md).

## 8. Feature research spike

The `SP` story opening every feature (ADR-0020), done **before** its implementation stories:

1. List every formula, algorithm, specification point and interface behavior the feature's stories need.
2. For each one: an existing verified `REF-*` or `DERIV-*`, or a new source found and read (levels 4–5, recorded in `docs/references.md` with its date), or a derivation written, or a research request opened (§5) — never "to be found later".
3. Write a research note `notes/NNNN-<feature>.md`: what was found, for which story, what remains open.
4. Update the stories: acceptance criteria from the sources' examples, `@see` targets in the tasks, blocked points.
5. Ask the Product Owner the business questions found on the way (`docs/domain/README.md` open questions).
