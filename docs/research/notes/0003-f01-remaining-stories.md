| EN-005 | CSS reduces every radius of a box by one factor `f = min(Lᵢ/Sᵢ)`; ADR-0007 keeps the factor but applies it per edge and per vertex | `REF-CSS-BR` §4.5 (quoted), `DERIV-local-radius-clamp`                              |

## Remaining open

- Display for a zero-size rectangle (no corner to round): question for the Product Owner, recorded in US-003; it blocks nothing.
- No source needed beyond these for F01; `REF-GG-FILLET` stays unverified and uncited.

## For the audit (AUD-001)

- `cyclicVertex` relies on JavaScript `%` and `.at` with negative indexes (ADR-0025): state the intent in its TSDoc.
- The center of the fillet is computed but not needed by the path data; keep it tested for later uses.
