# Research request 0004 — Regular polygons in process and synoptic symbols

**Status**: open — optional: the Product Owner may settle Q19 without it (SP-002)

## Precise question

Which regular polygons (number of sides, orientation: flat base or standing on a vertex) are used as outlines of graphical symbols in ANSI/ISA-5.1-2009 (R2022) Table 5.1.1, ISO 10628-2:2012, ISO 14617 and IEC 60617, and in the display guidance of ANSI/ISA-101.01-2015 and ANSI/ISA-18.2-2016 (for example alarm priority indicators)? For each one: the polygon, its orientation, its meaning, and the clause or table that defines it. Is the "diamond" a square standing on a vertex? Is any regular polygon with more than 8 sides used?

## Why it blocks

Q19 (`docs/domain/README.md`): the largest number of corners a regular polygon may have (F02, US-005 validity check). The Product Owner wants the limit to follow what synoptic and process symbols really use.

- [ ] table: polygon, sides, orientation, meaning, standard and clause
- [ ] complete reference (title, edition, year, URL of the publisher's page)
- [ ] whether a source was read directly or through a summary
- [ ] the largest number of sides found
