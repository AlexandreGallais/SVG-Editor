# Releases

Versions and changelog are produced from the commit history by **release-please** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`), from Conventional Commits.

1. Every push on `main` updates a release pull request (`chore(main): release x.y.z`) holding the next version in `package.json` and the new section of `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Merging that pull request tags `vx.y.z`, publishes the GitHub release, then **publishes the documentation site** to GitHub Pages (`docs` job of `release.yml`, `https://alexandregallais.github.io/synoptic-studio/`). The site can also be published by hand: _Actions → Release → Run workflow_.
3. release-please runs with the personal access token `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` (repository secret, fine-grained: Contents, Pull requests, Issues read and write; **expires 2026-12-31**, renew it before), so the CI runs on its pull requests.
4. The first version is `0.1.0` (`initial-version`): the library stays below `1.0.0` until the Product Owner decides it is stable.
