/**
 * Evaluated contour of a shape with corner radii: a closed sequence of segments and arcs.
 *
 * Radii are first clamped (`DERIV-local-radius-clamp`); each corner gets its fillet arc; each edge
 * becomes the segment between the arcs of its two corners. The sequence starts at the end of the
 * first corner's arc and closes with that arc (`DERIV-fillet-arc` step 7); pieces without length
 * are dropped. Vertices that turn back on themselves (spikes, τ = ±π) are outside the derivation
 * (open question Q16).
 *
 * @kind geometry
 * @param corners - vertices with their requested radii, clockwise from the top-left vertex (Q11)
 * @returns segments and arcs in drawing order, each starting where the previous one ends, within
 * `EPSILON`
 * @see DERIV-fillet-arc
