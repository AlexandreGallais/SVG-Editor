/**
 * Vertices of a regular polygon on the unit circle centered at the origin, with a horizontal
 * bottom edge (a flat base), in the SVG frame (y pointing down).
 *
 * The vertices run clockwise on screen from the topmost one, the leftmost on a tie (Q11, Q18):
 * the `j`-th is at the angle `βⱼ = −π/2 + (2⌊n/2⌋ + 1 − 2j) π / n` of the mathematical frame,
 * written `(cos βⱼ, −sin βⱼ)` once the y axis is flipped. The start is chosen by its index,
 * never by comparing floating coordinates. No coordinate is `−0`; one that is zero in exact
 * arithmetic may be off by about 1e-16 (cosine and sine of a double), which is accepted.
 *
 * @kind geometry
 * @param corners - number of corners `n`, an integer >= 3
 * @returns the `n` vertices in drawing order
 * @see DERIV-regular-polygon-fit
